# Multiple_Elements
This is a simple java program that first asks the user to enter 4 numbers. These numbers inhabit the first row in a multi-demensional array. The next two rows will be the first two multiples of the numbers above them. For example, if the user inputs 1, 2, 3 and 4, the 3-by-4 array will look like this:
1234 
2468 
36912
